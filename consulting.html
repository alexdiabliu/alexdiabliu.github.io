          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          
          <h3>Background & Objectives</h3>
          <p>
              The Rehabilitation Centre for Children (RCC) faces challenges delivering home exercise programs 
              to families with limited English proficiency. Our objective was to design a solution that supports 
              5+ languages, maintains a < Grade 6 reading level, and reduces interpreter reliance.
          </p>

          <h3>Analysis & Methodology</h3>
          <p>
              We evaluated three options: a custom app (AccessPhysio), adopting Physitrack, and a Do-Nothing approach. 
              Using a critical path analysis (shown below), we determined a 35-week implementation timeline was feasible.
          </p>

          <h3>Recommendation</h3>
          <p>
              We recommend developing <strong>AccessPhysio</strong>. As seen in the Cash Flow Analysis below, 
              while it requires upfront investment, it yields a positive Present Worth of $28,522 compared to 
              Physitrack's negative return.

        <h2>Course Reflection – IBEHS 4P03 Learning Portfolio</h2>

        <p>
          IBEHS 4P03 challenged me to move beyond purely technical problem-solving and think like a
          consultant working within a real health-care system. Our team’s project focused on improving
          access to pediatric physiotherapy instructions for families with limited English proficiency at the
          Rehabilitation Centre for Children (RCC). Throughout the term, I learned how engineering
          economics, project management, and stakeholder-centred design come together to support a
          solution that is not only technically feasible, but also financially justifiable and socially impactful.
        </p>

        <h3>My Role and Contributions</h3>
        <p>
          Within the team, I took a leading role in the scalability, strategy and project management components
          of the consulting report. I helped ideate methods to generate incoming cash flows for the proposed idea, ranging from external grants to licensing out the software to other clinics.
          I also aided in constrating the custom-built multilingual rehabilitation platform against adopting Physitrack and the
          do-nothing scenario in terms of feasibility and economies of scale, as it initially appeared as though Physitrack was more profitable. However this did not take into account the cheaper
           costs became as the platform scaled in size. Numbers such as these helped the team interpret what those numbers meant for RCC’s decision-making. I also contributed to
          developing the critical-path schedule, identifying which activities constrained the 35-week
          implementation timeline and where there was slack that could be used for crashing. Overall, my greatest contribution was bringing together the specializations of all team members into a cohesive executive summary as a foundation for the final report.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond the quantitative work, I contributed to writing and refining the consulting narrative so that
          the recommendations were clear to non-technical readers. This meant translating concepts like
          benefit–cost trade-offs, economies of scale, and capital–labour substitutions into intuitive language
          that highlighted how the platform would actually change daily workflows for physiotherapists and
          families. Collaborating with my teammates on the design description and recommendations pushed
          me to think about how interface mockups, figures, and structured headings can reinforce a written
          argument rather than just decorate it.
        </p>

        <h3>Skills and Learning from the Course</h3>
        <p>
          One of the biggest skills I developed in this course was the ability to link economic tools to real
          design decisions. Before 4P03, concepts like present worth, MARR, and benefit–cost ratios felt
          abstract, a distant memory from previous courses. Working through our own spreadsheet, I saw how small changes in assumptions about
          interpreter usage or adherence rates could change whether a project looks attractive or risky. This
          directly reinforced lecture content on uncertainty, sensitivity analysis, and public decision-making,
          and helped me appreciate why assumptions must be clearly stated and justified rather than quietly
          “baked into” calculations.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also gained experience in formal project management. Building the node diagram and Gantt-style
          schedule forced us to think carefully about dependencies, bottlenecks, and the difference between
          labour-intensive and capital-intensive phases of the project. Seeing how Activities A, B, D, E, F, G,
          H, L, and M formed the critical path made it clear that delays early in the requirements and
          prototyping stages would cascade into much longer deployment times. This has made me much
          more conscious of how I plan my own technical projects: getting alignment on scope early is not just
          “nice to have”, it has direct schedule and cost implications.
        </p>

        <h3>Alternative Outcomes and What I Would Do Differently</h3>
        <p>
          Looking back, there are a few key areas where our team’s decisions could have led to different
          outcomes. For example, we ultimately recommended the custom-built platform because it provided
          the strongest long-term present worth and the most flexibility for RCC’s needs. If we had placed
          more emphasis on short-term risk and implementation capacity, we might have leaned more heavily
          on the Physitrack adoption scenario as the primary recommendation, framing the custom platform
          as a longer-term “Phase 2” vision. That alternative would likely have reduced early development
          risk but at the cost of control over features, language expansion, and long-term equity goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          On a personal level, I would also approach the modelling process differently next time. Early in the
          project, our team spent a lot of time refining the design narrative before fully locking in the economic
          assumptions. In future projects, I would push to build a rough economic model earlier and run
          simple sensitivity checks as we go. This would help us identify which parameters (for example,
          interpreter wage rates or expected changes in adherence) actually drive the decision, and where
          we need stronger justification or data. I also see opportunities to more actively integrate risk and
          uncertainty tools – such as scenario analysis or break-even plots – into our main argument rather
          than treating them as add-ons.
        </p>

        <h3>Impact on My Future Practice</h3>
        <p>
          Overall, IBEHS 4P03 has changed how I think about engineering work in health care. I now see
          economic evaluation, social benefit considerations, and project management not as separate boxes,
          but as interconnected lenses for judging whether a solution is truly viable. The project also showed
          me how strong communication – through writing, visuals, and structured web content like this
          portfolio – can help busy clinicians and stakeholders quickly understand why a recommendation
          matters. These skills will directly carry into my future design courses, capstone projects, and
          eventually into industry roles where engineering decisions must be justified to both technical and
          non-technical audiences.
